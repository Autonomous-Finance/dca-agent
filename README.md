# Simple DCA Agent on AO

A DCA agent that swaps QuoteToken for BaseToken at regular intervals. 


It works in conjunction with 2 Cron process proxies
- 1 for triggering the swap
- 1 for updating the price as per associated liquidity pool

## Features

- direct interaction with pool, no router
- single owner (initially the deployment signer, but can be changed),
- single currency pair
- agent is supposed to be owned / controlled by user with an arweave wallet, not by another Agent (msg.From vs. Owner)

### Operate
- allows loading up with quote token
- allows withdrawals of base or quote token
- allows for total liquidation (return all in quote token)

### Configure
- base token, slippage, swapAmount are configured only once @ initialization
- quote token can't be configured


# Agent Deployment

## Prepare Lua code
Put all lua code into a single file using amalg - builds a single amalgamation file.
https://luarocks.org/modules/siffiejoe/amalg

To build on osx:
`/opt/homebrew/bin/amalg.lua -s process.lua -o build/output.lua ownership.ownership bot.bot validations.validations`

## In App
*swuw* == "signed with user wallet"

1. user configures the agent with base token, slippage, swap amount
2. user confirms deployment
   1. create main agent process (*swuw*)
   2. upon deployment confirmation, load `process.lua` 
   3. upon eval confirmation, `"Initialize"` (*swuw*)
   4. upon initialization confirmation, spawn cron proxy processes
      1. spawn process A, load `trigger-priceâ€“update.lua`, `"Initialize"` (*swuw*)
      2. spawn process B, load `trigger-swap.lua`, `"Initialize"` (*swuw*)


# TODO Requirements

Clarify: what constitutes a agent status ?
  - agent process state 
  - cron proxy processes state
  - peripheral info additional storage on arweave


# Dev Plan

Create working version for each iteration

1. Complete life cycle management for a simple process that has initialization, access control, top up and withdrawal, as well as retirement. Agent can only be configured in terms of currency. Should list past processes in the table.
   1. store latest agent id in localstorage
   2. query historic data and latest agent owned by current user - via graphql
   3. check that changing the owner works
2. Fully fledged dca agent with automation, includes state display of the active agent.
3. Add metrics for agent performance
4. Finesse for UX
   1. Prettify UI, 
   2. responsive to suit smaller devices
   3. display relevant info (my current balance) / make available actions more convenient
      1. click max available to input amount
      2. slider for 0% - 100% of available balance to input amount etc.
      3. Assist user in keeping track of all messages sent within the app (wallet doesn't help with that - central place for in-app logs)
   4. add animated stepper for deployment progress display
5. Reconsider agent design for blueprint-grade code quality (especially names & convenience functions, as well as req-response pattern)






This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
